# Zertz

This is an implementation of the Zertz board game. To learn more about Zertz, check out the [GIPF Project homepage](http://www.gipf.com/).

The application is written in plain C. It is built using the Gnome libraries.

It was written in 2002 and 2003, so there is no version history in Git. I was impressed that the Gnome libraries are so stable and backwards compatible. It built and ran just fine on a 2017 Ubuntu machine after I installed libgnomeui.

To try it out just clone and 

./configure
make
./src/zertz
